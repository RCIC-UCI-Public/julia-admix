      Julia {{version}} is is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming 
      language. While it is a general purpose language and can be used to write 
      any application, many of its features are well-suited for high-performance 
      numerical analysis and computational science.
      Distinctive aspects of Julia's design include a type system with parametric 
      polymorphism in a dynamic programming language; with 
      multiple dispatch as its core programming paradigm. Julia supports concurrent, 
      (composable) parallel and distributed computing. Binary Release
